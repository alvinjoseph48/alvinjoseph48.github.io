Projects
Criminal Database  | In House Application for District Attorney
Application that  allow users to search for criminals with different combination of parameters such as first name, gang name, association ,
nickname etc. Users can also add vehicles and weapons which then can be in turn associated with the criminals. The application was made from
scratch, in addition I was the only developer working on the App.


Habitat For Humanity Restore | Link: https://github.com/alvinjoseph48/HabitatForHumanityProject 
Software is implemented using a model view controller design. It is a database/store for Habitat for Humanity products. 
The employee can add items with different parameters including a image. In return it will be stored in a MySQL database. 
Customers can then search for products and add them to their cart. Customers are then allowed to checkout with a credit card.


College View | Link: https://github.com/alvinjoseph48/CollegeViewProject
Created an object oriented software with JavaFX. The GUI allows school administrators to organize students, faculty, textbooks
 and courses. Administrators will have the ability to search, create, delete and update any object into the data structure. In addition 
they have the option to import/export objects. The program is sophisticated enough to throw exceptions when detected invalid objects. 


Linked Lists | Link: https://github.com/alvinjoseph48/LinkedListProject
Created an object oriented software with JavaFX that allows users to create a random paragraph with input from the user. 
From the GUI, the user can select a text file with FileChooser, set the number of words and choose the first word of the random 
paragraph that will be generated by the program. The application analyzes the text file and stores the strings/words in the master
links list and/or the baby links list. Then the random paragraph will generate based on the user’s input.
